**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Special thanks to:

* @gdkchan ([Ryujinx](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx)'s author), without whom I would have been unable to understand many complex mechanisms of the Horizon kernel, such as the scheduler, etc. Ryujinx's kernel HLE is pretty accurate, and of course part of this work has strong similarites to Ryujinx's kernel code.
* @fincs, who helped me in the kernel reverse-engineering process a lot as well, and with countless other things too.
